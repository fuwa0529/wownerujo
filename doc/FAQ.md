## How do I use a node with username & password?
```username:password@node.address:portnumber```

Copying anything to the clipboard on Android exposes it to any other App running. So this
is a security measure to keep your seed safe(r). 

## Why does it make a 'monero' folder?
This is a new feature of monero core to share certain key images with other monero forks.
